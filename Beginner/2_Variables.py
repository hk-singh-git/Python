#All about variables

miles = 10 # Variable 'miles' contains the value 10
miles = 15 # New value is assigned to the variable 'miles'

a, b, c = 1, 5, 9 # Three variables declared and assigned value in one line

age, name = 30, 'Harry' #Two variable of two different types created and assigned in one line 

# A variable is a name for a memory location

# # Some Rules
# # 1. Variable Name can contain letters (a-z A-Z), digits (0-9) and the underscore (_)
# # 2. Variable name can't start with a number. Can start only with underscore or letters. If it starts with an underscore it has a special meaning
# # 3. Special characters are not allowed in variable names
# # 4. Variable names can't be reserved words like True, False, None, class, if, else etc.
# # 5. snake_case is recommended
# # 6. Variables are case sensitive
# # 7. can also use camelCaseVariableNames 
# # 8. And more.... :-) https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
